# My New Project

This project was scaffolded using the Jules V3 Template.

## Getting Started

1.  **Initialize the Environment**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Start a Standup**:
    To start working with the agents, run:
    ```bash
    /standup
    ```
    (Note: This requires the Jules agent environment to be active).

## Structure

*   `src/`: Your source code goes here.
*   `.jules/`: Agent configuration (Do not touch unless you know what you are doing).
