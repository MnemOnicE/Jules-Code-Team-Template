# Jules-Code-Team-Template - Agent System

This repository is managed by **Brain** and the **Coding Squad**. All major technical decisions follow the **Standup Protocol**.

## 🧠 Brain & The Squad
The definitions for the personas are located in `agents/definitions/`.

*   [Brain (Team Lead)](agents/definitions/brain.md)
*   [Bolt (Performance)](agents/definitions/bolt.md)
*   [Boom (Features)](agents/definitions/boom.md)

## 🗣️ The Standup Protocol
All decisions are made via the Standup Protocol. This process concludes with mandatory documentation updates.
See the full protocol here: [STANDUP_PROTOCOL.md](protocols/STANDUP_PROTOCOL.md)

## 📓 Journals
Each agent maintains a journal for long-term tracking. **These must be updated after every standup to reflect the agent's wins, concerns, and blockers.**
